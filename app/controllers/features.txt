Feature List For the Top Shelf Whiskey App:

    1. User Registration: Users can register for an account by providing a username, email, and password. The app validates the input using the "is_valid_user" method and the EMAIL_REGEX pattern for email validation. If the input is valid, the user's password is hashed using Bcrypt, and the user data is saved. The user is then logged in and redirected to their whiskey shelf.

    2. User Login: Users can log in to their accounts by providing their email and password. The app checks if the email exists in the database and verifies the entered password against the stored hashed password using Bcrypt. If the login is successful, the user is redirected to their whiskey shelf; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

    3. Logout: Users can log out of their accounts, which clears the session data and redirects them to the app's main page.

    4. Main Page: The main page serves as the starting point for users to log in, register, or navigate to other app features.

    5. User Authentication: Users must be logged in to access the whiskey management features.

    6. File Upload: Users can upload images of whiskey bottles in PNG, JPG, JPEG, or GIF formats. Images are compressed and saved to a specified directory.
